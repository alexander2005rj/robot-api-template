Here we create the keywords needed to act directly with the services (API).

It is a good way to start by always creating the keyword related to the session we are going to work with. In the example contained in the folder, we will be able to see how each keyword works and how they are divided into related services and methods.

All files contained here must end with `_services.resource`, since they are API resources that will be used in the `RESOURCES` folder.

In the `example` folder, you can better understand how the separation of responsibilities works.
