Here we will create the resources needed for use in the tests. The resources will be created in keyword format.

The resources must be separated into folders (e.g. login) and must be self-explanatory. It is also important to use the `[Documentation]` argument to explain how they work.

These resources can be varied. From test steps to even creating custom setups and teardowns.

Here we also use all the services (API) created in the `SERVICES` folder.
All files contained here must end with the `.resource` extension.

I will leave a folder named `example` to help with understanding.
