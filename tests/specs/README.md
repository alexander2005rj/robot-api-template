Here we keep our tests themselves. In the other folders, we separate the calls to the endpoints (`SERVICE` folder) and their use with other necessary resources (`RESOURCES` folder).

The tests must be created with the same names as your services and resources. And they must end with `_tests.robot`.

In all our tests, we will use the keywords created within the corresponding `RESOURCES` folder.

In the examples folder, you can better understand how our tests are more readable and simple!
